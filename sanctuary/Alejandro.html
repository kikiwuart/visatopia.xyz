            The concept of my work was to display the
            everyday sounds we might think as annoying on a daily basis, and really focus
            on how soothing they can be. The sounds I chose come from specific places,
            and activities that I personally enjoy. Going out to the beach, listening to kids
            play, walking down a busy street, and even going outside on a sunny day to look
            at the sky. All these things occur in our everyday lives, but most of us don’t take
            the time to appreciate the sounds coming from these activities and places. I took
            videos of oceans, skies, birds, children playing, and other sounds and sights that
            we can see and hear. I chose the different videos so that the sounds can go
            hand in hand with, while the video is being displayed. I chose to use different
            video clips and join them together using Adobe Premiere Pro to make one video
            collage. Preferably, I would like my viewers to see this installation in a dark room
            with a big screen and the sounds coming from different sides of the room as
            each video is being shown on the screen (surround sound). To display this in an
            art gallery, ideally, I would like to have the video played from a big screen, or
            projected onto a dark wall. As stated above, I would like the sound to be coming
            from different areas of the room so that the viewer can hear each specific sound
            with the corresponding video clip. My goal is to have the viewer feel a sense of
            relaxation as well as make them want to explore for themselves the beauty of the
            everyday sights and sounds we see and hear.
