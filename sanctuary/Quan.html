            Quarantine. Shelter-in-Place. Stay-at-Home Order. Regardless of the policy name, due to COVID-19, people are
            staying home more than ever. As a result, once lively and bustling cities are now modern ghost towns,
            especially areas with concentrations of Asian populations. Through combining a ghost town concept with
            Cyberpunk and Asian Nightlife aesthetics, I wanted to recreate an empty or "Forgotten" city as an exhibition
            to house my "lively" art work on the large screens and business signs within the exhibition. Due to the
            quarantine, the city is in an isolated state. Hence, the glass dome. In terms of Cyberpunk, I used mostly
            cool colors such as blues, purples, and pinks. To convey that this exhibition is based around Asian
            Nightlife, I created lanterns and an entrance gate via Meshmixer and placed them very close to eachother in
            a walk way -- similar to the streets of San Fransisco's Chinatown. Although there are aspects of Chinatown
            such as the lanterns and the gate entrance, I did not want it to be only representative of one cultural
            enclave such as a Chinatown or a Little Tokyo. Thus, there is no text on any of the signs.
