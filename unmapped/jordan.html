            For our exhibition, we decided to use various mediums to display potential realities that our generation may
            have to face in the future. This exhibition explores the foreseeable apocalyptic scenarios; specifically a
            nuclear instigated apocalypse and an artificial intelligence instigated apocalypse. Our exhibition is thus
            split into different areas and the gallery buildings created are themed for each scenario we are creating.
            The nuclear apocalyptic building consists of a damaged building with holes and cracks whereas the artificial
            intelligence side features a more futuristic, sleek building style. On the walls of these galleries, there
            are two dimensional works that serve as windows for realities outside of those buildings. The windows show a
            scene one could see on the outside of this building that "exixts" in that potential reality. The galllery
            space itself as well as the works are merged in this way to show the viewer the dangers that are relevant
            not only to the future generations, but also this generation.
