            The ideas behind this piece were threefold, but we were able to find a very successful melding of them. The
            Skeleton
            with human features projected onto it was meant to represent the inner world (The skeleton) differing from
            the outer
            world (the projection of human emotion and form). The skeleton is wearing the projection as its skin,
            inviting a
            conversation about what this world projects onto us, and how we respond to it.

            The cloud imagery allows us to draw the connection between the creative process and the brainstorm. The
            projection of
            different colors of ink dripping down into the water represents the undisturbed mind and the ink
            representing various
            thoughts, ideas, or emotions. Furthermore, we wanted to draw into mind the cycle of rain, through
            condensation,
            precipitation, and eventually evaporation as it relates to the creative process. The final element, the
            floor projection
            is the culmination of the creative experience. The individual droplets fall down to the surface of the water
            and cause
            ripples, much like how art precipitates from the mind of the artist and in turn affects the world around
            them.
