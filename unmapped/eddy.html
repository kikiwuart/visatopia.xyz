            Our project name is “Mythical Grounds”. The project is supposed to give a feeling of nature but yet a
            feeling of being somewhere mystical. You would be able to walk into this place and hear the life of nature,
            birds chirping or even the water from the pond trickling down the stone. You might even feel the wind that
            goes through the bushes and or trees. The context of this project was that we decided to go with the theme
            of nature because of this quarantine. We wanted to make a mixture of mythological things with the
            surrounding environments of wildlife. As with the mythology, we have a story that depends on the good force
            versus the evil force. The goblin heads were the symbols of evil; where they can explode with hate and
            wickedness. With the unicorns and the fluffy dog-bunnies, they are the good forces within this piece where
            they keep the evil from escaping the area. With that in mind, we tie that to the present time with the
            quarantine. We wanted to make a mixture of mythological things with the surrounding environments of
            wildlife. As with the mythology, we wanted to go with a similar style with Norse myths. We have a story that
            depends on the good force versus the evil force. The goblin heads were the symbols of evil; where they can
            explode with hate and wickedness. With the unicorns and the fluffy dog-bunnies, they are the good forces
            within this piece where they keep the evil from escaping the area. It would be a place where people can only
            access if they were "pure-hearted" and or filled with serenity. With that in mind, we tie that to the
            present time with the quarantine. We hope that everyone is able to enjoy “Mythical Grounds” as it shows the
            ways of how nature is with art in it!
