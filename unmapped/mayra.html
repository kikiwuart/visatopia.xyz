            In this gallery, I want viewers to experience different emotions.
            The first part of my installation video works to create feelings of fear, loneliness, and an
            isolated-in-space kind of feeling. The second part of the video would be to create feelings of calmness,
            happiness, and at peace of mind with the brighter colors (compared to the previous video). All of these
            emotions I attempt to evoke through the usage of different audios adapted from Freesound.org. The final
            part of the installation video works to create anxiety by including a repetitive sound that sounds like a
            rapidly beating heart. As it progresses, it eventually slows down and is followed by the sound of water
            as a way to signal that the anxiety is reducing. To present this art piece, I imagine making this
            installation in a pitch dark room with the installation taking up the majority of the space on one wall,
            preferably the one opposite the entrance.
