            <!-- write a short description about your museum, your artwork......-->
            Our museum centers around the idea of Sci-Fi. We focused on making models that fit the description of
            Sci-fi, as well as making them go along with the theme we created with not only the building, but also the
            gallery interior. The feel we went for was a dark, almost evil, side of Sci-fi, that we not only pulled
            inspiration from, but that you would be able to relate to some of the modern sci-fi movies and art of today.
            This gallery could easily fit inside the landscapes of movies like Star Wars, but we see this gallery being
            placed in the middle of a city, towering over the buildings surrounding it. With the dark architecture and
            red highlights on the building, it ties into the models we created, as well as give off the feeling of
            wonder for what is inside.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our models are placed around a scene that looks like the inside of a sci-fi office building and are meant to
            show the 3D models, as well as the 2D plans, as if they were a part of the room. Our 3D models are a peek at
            what some of the inventions of the future might look like with models of a Sci-Fi enhanced car to a powered
            container that glows and holds a radioactive rock. Just one look from the outside of the building would
            already connect you to the people that may occupy this building, but the inside is where our models are
            displayed as ideas that run parallel to the look of our gallery.
