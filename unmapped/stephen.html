            Kālacakra, or time wheel, has the meaning of mortality, endless life circle of time. The traditional
            design of
            Kālacakra is dense and layered, in which every layer symbolizes a ritual and sacred practice of Buddhism, it
            could be
            the ancient idea of multiple universes, that everything is happening at the same time. I was inspired by its
            comprehensive style which advocates the idea of equality for all living beings.
            Holding a time wheel and spinning it, we can view all the details with flexible viewpoints.
