            Not enough people remember to “stop and smell the roses”, and in a greater perspective, care about the
            environment. So when the day comes and common flowers become endangered to the point of extinction, society
            will regret not paying more attention to environmental issues and making changes that will be good for the
            earth. I created this virtual gallery of flowers that act as a sanctuary for common flowers like roses,
            daisies, lily of the valley, etc. My aesthetic inspiration came from my love of video games and the idea of
            preserving the beauty of nature.
