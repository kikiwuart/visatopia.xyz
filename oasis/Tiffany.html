            This is an outdoor museum that is welcome for humans and animals such as birds. The side that is in the
            opposite end of the garden is an open roof building so natural light can shine inside creating an outdoor
            feel. This museum would look a lot like a garden but with different art projected and installed in there.
            There would be some weird sculptures, video art, and paintings in this museum. This museum is a chill place
            for people to relax and to be in peace. The weird sculptures are there to make people laugh and feel happy.
