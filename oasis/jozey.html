            The possibilities in life are endless, however people forget the reason why life was created. Animals were
            born before humans, the galaxy was born before Earth, and the universe was born before anything. I wanted to
            show the world the endless reasons why nature should be understood more. To show the beauty of the stars,
            because nowadays no one cares about nature as much as they used to. People are always on their phone,
            computer, or any type of technology and not being grateful for what nature has given us. The bunny
            represents peace and love, because bunnies are innocent and adorable. The elephant represents possibilities
            and adventure, because they are only found in special areas of the planet, you can't see them near unless
            you go to a zoo. The tree represents life and death, because it is green, it grows, it feeds, but it can
            also die just like a human. Nature is everything in this world, and everyone taken that for granted, so this
            garden represents what people have been missing.
