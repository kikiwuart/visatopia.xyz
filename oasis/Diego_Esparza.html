            So this was first attempt at make something useing a 3 dimention platoform which proved more difficult that
            it was for me to do. But after trying to figure out what object I was tring to create, I stoped to look at a
            vase in my home full of peacock feathers tand then I found what I had wanted to make. After creating it I
            had a much more difficult time trying to create it's texture design with was more complicated that I had
            expected, so I decided to add it's texture design using photoshop. I made this because I wanted to make
            something that not only looked weird but had a texture that was weird yet abstract enough to grab the
            veiwers attention to see what exacally they where looking at.
            As for the Video, I wanted to do something visually appealing and entrancing for th viewer. like some sort
            of LSD trip, I wanted some kind of effect like a Mandala but more centered around a split and moving image
            that moved in random locations at the same time.
