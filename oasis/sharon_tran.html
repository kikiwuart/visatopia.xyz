            Crossing on Foliage is my desire to create my own utopian world. This world was inspired by the video game
            series, "Animal Crossing". I was captivated with their vibrant aspect that encompasses the bright and
            postive emotions. By creating a natural and rural space of what I called "Crossing on Foliage", I envision
            the preservation of the greenery by bringing out the beauty of flowers covered in frost in sunflower, aloe
            vera, and hibiscus flower. As well as displaying a glass-like sculptures to focus on the environmental
            aesthetics. My purpose of this exhibtion is not just about capturing the aesthetics of my utopian world, but
            to encapsulate the synergistic energy of healing towards self-awareness. With reflective mirrors and glass
            invokes the transparency of self reflection.
