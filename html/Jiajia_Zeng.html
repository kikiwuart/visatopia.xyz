            As boys, we are usually attracted by ferocious animals or moving machines. In front of the TV, we watched these but couldn't touch them. So we often desire to have these things. We dreamed of traveling around the world on a cool plane or train or riding a beast to dominate the world.  We dreamed that drive the spaceship that is from the Star War to go anywhere in a few seconds. We dreamed that we can go traveling by train so that we can enjoy the landscapes on the road. We are not alone in this journey, we are always accompanied by partners to go through all journeys. Thus, we go learn 3D modeling and Illustrator so that we can have them on the computer. As what we like is more complex than before, we have to upgrade our skills to make them. All of those 3D works make through cinema4D.
