            This mesuem was made with peace and the sense of safety in mind. The viewers will be able to enjoy the view
            of nature outside of the mesuem without fearing that anyone would be looking at them, this is done for the
            sake of creating that sense of both peace and safety. Similarly, the gallery is broken up into different
            smaller rooms for the sake of giving the viewers more personal space. I also included a number of domestic
            animals in hopes of replicating the feeling of home, and the safety and peace we associate with "home".
