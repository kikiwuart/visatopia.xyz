            <!-- write a short description about your museum, your artwork......-->
            My mini museum is a representation of some of the things that I enjoy from the past and present or find
            great importance in my life. The first image shows a 3D object that represents a tree which is inspired by
            the idea of nature and also the thought of how much importance trees are for the environment. I want to
            bring the attention towards protecting our trees because they are super beneficial for our planet.
            For the second image, it shows colored balls stacked up and overall creating a triangular shape which came
            from the idea of how much I used to enjoy chewing gumballs from the machines at the grocery stores. I also
            was fascinated at viewing at the colors of the gumballs, so that's why I created each ball to be a different
            color.
            For the third image, it includes two dog houses and an image of my two dogs. I chose to create this because
            I just love my dogs and they have helped relief my stress. They are just a big part of my life.
            The fourth image which is the one with the avatar carrying a shopping bag and a cell phone. I wanted to
            create an avatar that looked weird and sort of scary, but also quite humorous. This avatar is a
            representation of what I like to do because I enjoy shopping. The cell phone idea came from having to be on
            my cell phone a lot especially now since the "shelter in place" order started from COVID-19 happen so I feel
            like my phone and I are inseparable right now. I love horror movies so I wanted my avatar to look scary and
            weird with oversized arms and undersized legs.
            The fifth image will have a variety of 3D poles that are in different colors and the inspiration came from
            the public art installation called "Urban Light" located in Los Angeles, California so I wanted to create
            something along those lines.
            The last image includes photos of flowers that I shot from my DSLR camera and the idea came from just
            admiring the beauty that nature brings to us.
            I wanted to emphasize the beauty and color of the flowers.
