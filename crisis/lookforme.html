            Yixin was described environment pollution is happening on our earth home. She took some inspiration from
            photographer Alberto Seveso, who captured clouds of ink underwater. Therefore, she decided to use ink
            rendering is a metaphor for air chemical pollution. She injected the acrylic paint into the water with a
            syringe needle. The acrylic paint like clouds in the water, slowly covered the village, the woods,
            giving a sense of suffocation.
            About this ink rendering projection, could capture the audience's interaction and move their feelings.
            There is the collision of two primary colours of yellow and blue, and the fusion of complementary
            colours of yellow and purple. Besides, the mixture of colours creates a chaotic atmosphere that covers
            the houses and woods like human beings surrounded by chemical gases. People use more natural resources,
            the earth will wear out faster, and our homeland will disappear in future. I hope that this project of
            my art will bring people to think about the ecological environment needs in future.

            My concept of this video art is polluted sea.In the present era where we live, environmental
            pollution is serious the earth in the middle also represents polluted seas worldwide.In
            particular, a lot of trash thrown into the sea. My materials were used as recyclable or
            non-recycling waste which is common around us.The reason why i chose these materials are
            used is because of the largest amount of trash thrown into the sea such as plastic,
            paper.Viewers who see my work able to see my work as pollution of the sea and feel how
            serious ocean pollution is in our time.

            I created a <a href="juliankern.html">3D sculpture</a> that is trying to draw attention to all trash that
            has been dumped into the
            ocean.
            When you look at what specific items are being dumped, you realize that disposable items make up a large
            portion
            of the offending materials. These are things like drinking straws, water bottles, food wrappers, and
            plastic bags.
            Many of these items are things we do not give a second thought to when we throw them away. For my 3D
            sculpture,
            I combined a sculpt of a turtle with its baby and a happy meal container. What I want to say with my
            piece is that
            there is so much trash in the ocean that it is literally becoming part of the sea animals. I think there
            is also a
            sad irony that this happy meal, meant for children, is what’s poisoning this turtle and its child. I have
            also included a video of my 2nd project, as I feel its message is what prompted my 3D sculpture.

            This is a projection about how we view the world around us. Different people see the world in their
            own way and in this projection the world is distorted and manipulated. The sound is what snaps us
            back into reality while we experience the unnatural.

            This is focusing on the Medical Microcosm, I want to turn the whole video's
            feeling into a mysterious and melancholic environment by using color bluish-green and blue.
            Also, I want to talk about video projection in a glass container to imitate a larger version
            of the container to store these microscopic creatures, because in real life these tiny
            things
            can only be seen through a microscope. I found some related videos from the website,
            using Premiere Pro to collage them. The video is from the beginning of the process of
            dividing
            the fertilized egg, which shows that people grow from the initial cells.
            These short videos are used to show that after we grow up, life is composed of different
            things.
            Although their size is very small, they are still important.
