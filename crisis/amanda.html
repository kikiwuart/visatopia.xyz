            My project is a gravity defying complex of three hexagons meant to show our victory over the current
            pandemic. My idea
            is an atypical reality where the viewer could “float” throughout the museum from the bottom up. These
            hexagons are
            transparent glass overlaid with a transparent digital composition created from a view of earth from space
            with a burning
            continent viewable, a drone aerial view of a crowd of people and an asymmetrical view of a stain glass
            window all
            blended together and placed on each glass wall of the entire museum complex.
            <br>
            The three sculptures and the “stained glass” walls of the museum are a representation of the current
            pandemic and my
            hope for overcoming this trying time in the near future. The larger sculpture in the larger bottom hexagon
            represents
            the pandemic, the virus, the deaths, and the “party” the virus is having by collecting human lives.
            <br>
            The top two sculptures represent humanity overcoming the virus pandemic. The female sculpture shows
            “Victory” and also
            shows the “seed” of humanity sprouting again, it is a representation of our resiliency and ability to
            overcome hardship.
            Overcoming this hardship is depicted in the victory sculpture by the statue “smashing” the virus under both
            feet. The
            male sculpture references the “heart” of humanity as well as the concept that love conquers all, that we
            should see the
            connection of love for each other as well as our worldwide humanity in the face of this crisis.
