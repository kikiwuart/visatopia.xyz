            We are living in an interesting time. Now it is 2020, and the people are very proud of what they have
            accomplished from technology to medicine all around the world, but they just figured out they have not done
            enough! The world has been dealing with the Corona Virus for about four months, but there is no cure for it.
            The only thing we know is hand washing, and the use of hand sanitizers is vital for infection prevention.
            Despite all of the uncertainty going around the world, people know we are all together. No matter what color
            of skin you have, which country you live in, and how much money you have, we can all get infected with this
            dangerous virus. This virus may have caused so many issues around the world, but it brought one thing that
            we all forgot which is we are all human beings and equal.
