            Flooded Modernization is created from the thought that society is flooded inside this world of technology
            and electronics.
            My gallery is inspired by artists who do home installations, so mine is made inside a modernized home with
            furniture facing the screens of technology. Behind the technology is the small city. The technology
            symbolizes the amount of time people spend on their devices, so the technology is as tall as the buildings.
            It is an installation that I want people to be able to walk through and feel a sensation of walking through
            a town that is flooded underwater.
