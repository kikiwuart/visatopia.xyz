            One of the most prevalent situations in our lives right now is the lockdown as a result of the coronavirus
            spreading around the country. When the semester first began,
            I made a video piece when the news about the virus was first coming out before the lockdown showing how to
            wash ones hands. This video has remained topical throughout
            the semester, and thus most of my projects seem to revolve around it. For this piece, I created 3D models of
            hands about to be washed in a sink using MeshMixer and editted the
            meshes and images using Photoshop. The piece was made as not only an homage to my first video project, but
            also to further my skills in 3D modeling, which I hope to
            pursue more in my art career. I want the piece to be a reminder of the mantra we seem to have all taken
            during these times, to always remember to wash your hands.
